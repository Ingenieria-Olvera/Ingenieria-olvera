**'Profesional College Freshman'**


I'm a freshman in college putting out my mechatronics projects to hopefully build connections. I am inspired from engineers on youtube such as, [Hacksmith Industries](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjgpFI5dU-D1-kh9H1muoxQ), [Allen Pan](https://www.youtube.com/@allenpan), [Micheal Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelReeves) as well as Movies, TV shows, and Comics.

### 🗄️ Finished Projects
- [Quipy](https://github.com/Qco-t/Quipy):
  - A personal voice assistant that uses voice commands to control Spotify, display the weather, turn on LED lights, and display jokes on a TFT screen. This project taught me how to use Spotify and weather APIs, connect to WiFi, use a voice module, and display images on an LCD screen. This project taught me the challenges of debugging and the rewarding experience of creating functional, real-world technology. **This project was a foundational experience, solidifying my problem-solving skills and passion for developing practical, integrated systems.**


- [Personalized AI](https://github.com/Ingenieria-Olvera/Friday_Personalized_Assistant):
  - I was inspired by Iron Man and his personalized assistant Jarvis/Friday who helps Tony Stark in any challenges he faces, I aim to do something similar. I use Googles Generative AI and text-to-speech libarries to make my own Friday. That has helped me in the creation of the Ionic Wind Generator and Gauss Rifle.


- [Ionic Wind Project](https://github.com/Ingenieria-Olvera/Ionic_Wind_Gen):
  - Based off of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnCmvxt2jn8&t=484s) desgin made by [integza](https://www.youtube.com/@integza). I made a working Ionic Wind generator. I faced a lot of setbacks and design challenges I didn't think I would run into, yet with perseverance, I was able to make a functioning prototype. I am continuing this project to make the wind it produces even stronger, to hopefully figure out how to apply it to aircraft like drones.

### 🗂️ Current Projects    
- [Personalized Note Taking Device - Clear_Note](https://github.com/Ingenieria-Olvera/Clear_Note):
  - I have found myself in way too many situations looking to design or learn on the go. Only to realize I do not have a pen and paper and I also do not like the process of trying to take notes on my phone. Which is why I am developing something that solves that problem for me known as Clear_Note.  


- [AR Glasses - ARCH](https://github.com/Ingenieria-Olvera/Arch):
  - I was inspired by Iron Mans jarvis and the Spiderman far from home E.D.I.T.H glasses so I wanted to make my own.


#

### 📇 Unfinished Projects
- [Modular Wind Turbine]():
  - I was inspired by my finaicnally difficult upbringing to create a compact modular Wind Turbine that I hope to bring to others so that they can have a cost effective green source of energy.


- [Hit and Run](https://github.com/Ingenieria-Olvera/Hit-Run):
  - I love video games, especially games that make you feel free or fluid. I was inspired by games like Titan Fall, Apex Legends, and Lucio from Overwatch. To build a prototype of the game I always wished was made. While this is still in development, I have made enough progress as to where I am happy to share it with others here.


- [Magic Mirror]():
  - I love futuristic looking stuff and my dorm room is honestly a little boring so I think this would be a fun learning experince and also a fun project to tackle.

#

### 🧑‍🎓 Current Learning
- [Hardware Hacking](https://github.com/Qco-t/Hardware_hacking):
  - As mentioned previously, I have always been inspired by Iron Man and the cartoon scientist Rick from Rick and Morty. These characters are able to deconstruct random pieces of technology that seem to be nonfunctional and rebuild them into masterpieces. This sort of mastery over technology is something I aim to achieve, which is why I am documenting my hardware hacking projects in hopes of one day reaching their fictional level.

- [Arduino C++ Deep Dive]():
  - Here I am just going to put all my deep dive knowldge on coding for microcontrollers.

 - [Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Assembly Programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/arm-cortex-m-assembly-programming/learn/lecture/5606856#content)
   - I am currently self studying this course over at Udemy to build my embedded systems knowldge
  
- [ARM Cortex-M Interfacing with Keyboards and LCD's](https://www.udemy.com/course/arm-cortex-m-interfacing-with-keyboards-and-lcds/learn/lecture/6190568#overview)
  - I am currently self studying this course over at Udemy to build up my Cortex-M knowldge
 
- [Learn KiCad V6 and STM32 Hardware Design](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-kicad-v6-and-stm32-hardware-design/learn/lecture/30585336?start=0#overview)
  - I am curretnly self studying this course over at Udemy to build up my kicad knowladge
- [Introduction to Robotics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-12-introduction-to-robotics-fall-2005/download/)
  - I am currently taking this Open courseware MIT course in order to learn more about robotics.

- [Opencv Bootcamp](https://courses.opencv.org/dashboard)
  - I am also learning from the Opencv bootcamp

### 🏆 Awards/Certifications
- **Fabrication Laboratory Award**
  - Earned from my progress in creating a personal assistant through the school year, awarding my innovation, design, and programming prowess. **This award was a significant recognition of my hands-on approach to engineering, highlighting my ability to innovate and implement complex designs from concept to a functioning prototype within a collaborative lab environment. It reinforced my commitment to continuous learning and application of practical skills.**

- **MITx 6.002.1x**
  - I am currently taking on EdX MITx 6.002.1x, Circuits and Electronics 1: Basic Circuit Analysis, and I am getting my certificate here. This has truly challanged me in the relm of electronics, I started with no real knowldge on the topic and left with a good grasph on Electronics. **This course has been transformative, fundamentally changing my understanding of electrical engineering. It challenged me to develop a robust analytical framework for circuit analysis, moving from a conceptual understanding to a deep, practical grasp of foundational electronic principles.**

### 🔮 Future
I want to pursue a career in mechatronics engineering, hopefully working for the likes of NASA, Tesla Robotics, or Boston Dynamics. I am driven by eco friendly engineering, I aim to bring nature and robotics to work simultaneously, along with discovering new possibilites when it comes to exploring/learning about space. I plan on achinving this dream by going into Electrical Engineering in college, and building series connections with companys that share my goal. I aim to work on projects that do just that, eco friendly engineering like a simple air turbine generator, waste repurposing Robots--very WalE, the sky's the limit. And if all goes wrong, I'll start a youtube channel or something.
