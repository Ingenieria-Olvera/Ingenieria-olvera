# ü•ê Ingeniera-Olvera


**'Professional highschool student'**


I'm a senior in highschool putting out my mechatronics projects to hopefully build connections. I am inspired from engineers on youtube such as, [Hacksmith Industries](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjgpFI5dU-D1-kh9H1muoxQ), [Allen Pan](https://www.youtube.com/@allenpan), [Micheal Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelReeves) as well as Movies, TV shows, and Comics.

### üìÇ Current/Recent Projects
- [Quipy](https://github.com/Qco-t/Quipy) - A personal voice assistant uses voice commands to control Spotify, display the weather, turn on LED lights, and shows jokes on a TFT screen. This project taught me how to use Spotify and weather APIs, connect to WiFi, use a voice module, along with displaying images on a LCD screen. This project taught me the challenges of debugging, along with the rewarding experince of creating functional, real-world technology. **This is the standard, remember colleges will see this, hopefully.**
- [Robotic Tentacle](https://github.com/Qco-t/Tentacle-project) - Based off of Doctor Octavius' mind controlled tentacles, I set out to make a joystick controlled tentacle with a gripper.
- [Hardware Hacking](https://github.com/Qco-t/Hardware_hacking) - Inspired by Iron Man and Rick from Rick and Morty, who can deconstruct random technologies and rebuild them into something incredible. I'm on a journy to learn hardware hacking. Follow my journey here.
- [Spider Man Mask](https://github.com/Qco-t/Spider-Tingle) - Based off of the [Hacksmith Industries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQgWBzY1hR0) project, I want to create my own spider tingle mask.
- [Ionic Wind Project](link here) - Based off of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnCmvxt2jn8&t=484s) desgin made by [integza](https://www.youtube.com/@integza). I plan to make a working ionic wind generater that I can hopefully use to figure out how I can apply it to aircrats like drones.

### üèÜ Awards/Certifications
**Fabrication Laboratory Award** Earned from my progress in creating a personal assistant through the school year, awarding my innovatoin, desgin, and programming prowess.
**Give a little more detail on the signifiance of this reward and what you have learned from it.**

#

### üîÆ Future
I want to pursue a career in mechatronics engineering, hopefully working for the likes of NASA, Tesla Robotics, or Boston Dynamics. 
And if all goes wrong, I'll start a youtube channel or something. **Go more indepth with giving a brief statement on how you plan to achive these goals or specific steps you're taking toward them. Showing you are all bite no bark.**
